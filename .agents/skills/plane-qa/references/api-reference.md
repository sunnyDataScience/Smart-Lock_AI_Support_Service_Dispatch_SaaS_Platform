# Plane QA — REST API reference

## Auth: two parallel URL trees, same handlers

| Tree   | Prefix                                                       | Auth                               | Consumers               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Public | `/api/v1/workspaces/{slug}/projects/{project_uuid}/testing/` | `X-API-Key` header + rate throttle | SDK, CLI, MCP, CI, curl |
| App    | `/api/workspaces/{slug}/projects/{project_uuid}/testing/`    | Session cookie                     | Web UI only             |

Permissions (`ProjectEntityPermission`): reads need active project membership; writes need role ADMIN(20) or MEMBER(15). Non-member API key → 403.

## Domain model

```
Project
├─ TestFolder (tree via parent FK; unique(project,parent,name))
├─ TestCase (per-project sequence; current_version pointer; archived_at soft-archive)
│   ├─ TestCaseVersion (IMMUTABLE; unique version per case; title/description/preconditions/priority/tags)
│   │   └─ TestStep (IMMUTABLE; position; action; expected_result)
│   ├─ TestCaseWorkItemLink → Issue        (requirement coverage)
│   ├─ FileAsset(TESTING_ARTIFACT, entity_identifier=case UUID) (attachments)
│   └─ TestCaseAutomationLink              (unique(project,source,external_id) → maps CI results to cases)
├─ TestRun (status draft/active/completed; run_type fixed/live; build; configuration; cycle?; module?)
│   ├─ TestRunCase (pins test_case_version; latest_status open/passed/failed/blocked/skipped)
│   │   └─ TestResult (APPEND-ONLY; sequence; status passed/failed/blocked/skipped; actual_result; duration_ms)
│   │       └─ TestResultIssueLink → Issue (defect)
│   └─ TestAutomationIngestion (1:1 run; unique(project,idempotency_key); payload_hash; diagnostics)
```

All rows carry workspace/project FKs + audit fields + soft-delete; `clean()` enforces single-project consistency across every FK.

The search syntax is a field-query DSL, not SQL. Unknown fields are rejected; arbitrary database statements are never executed. Example: `type:test_case priority:high tag:smoke "card payment"`.

### Write a case the way the editor reads it back

Storage is unchanged — `preconditions` plus ordered `(action, expected_result)` pairs — and it stays
that way because the execution workspace, the CSV export and the auto-built defect description all
read the three parts separately. What changed is the web editor: a case is now written and shown as
one Gherkin block, mapped `Given` → `preconditions`, each `When` → an `action`, the `Then` that
follows → that step's `expected_result`, with `And`/`But` and bare lines continuing whatever came
last.

Nothing about the payload changes, but a case authored over the API is displayed through that
mapping, so shape it to survive the round trip:

- Put setup in `preconditions`, not in the first step's `action` — it renders as `Given`.
- One action per step. Two actions crammed into one `action` come back as `When … And …`, which
  reads as one step with two halves rather than two steps.
- Multi-line values are fine: the second and later lines render as `And`.
- An `action` with an empty `expected_result` renders a `When` with no `Then`, which reads as an
  unfinished case.

### States: resolve by name, and expect more than one per group

A project's states are data, not an enum, and a project seeded with the SDLC set carries 14 of them
— `Planning`, `In Design`, `In progress`, `In developing`, `PR Reviewing`, `In Diversity Testing`,
`PM Retest`, `Pending` and `Wait to Release` all share the `started` group. Code that maps group →
state silently keeps whichever row the queryset yielded last, so resolve the **name** from `states/`
and pass the UUID.

The group still decides four things, which is why the mapping is not cosmetic: coverage treats
every group except `backlog`/`cancelled` as owing a contract, the release gate counts a defect open
until its group is `completed` or `cancelled` (so a defect sitting in `Wait to Release` still
blocks), `completed_at` is stamped on entry to `completed`, and cycle progress counts
`completed + cancelled` as delivered.

### Workspace-scoped views

Relative to `/api/v1/workspaces/{slug}/` — the same handlers with no project segment:

| Method                      | Path                       | Purpose                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GET/POST · GET/PATCH/DELETE | `views/` · `views/{uuid}/` | Views spanning every project in the workspace; responses carry `project: null` |

Visibility for both scopes is the model's own rule, not the browser's: your views plus every `access: 1` (public) one. `access: 0` is private to its owner, and a key acts for its user.

Pages have no public endpoints. Their content is a Yjs CRDT document, so an HTML-only write is safe only for a page that has never been opened; that is out of scope here.

Create or update a Work Item with custom values using `properties`, keyed by property UUID:

```json
{
  "name": "Validate checkout on Chrome",
  "type_id": "<enabled-work-item-type-uuid>",
  "milestone": "<same-project-milestone-uuid>",
  "properties": {
    "<browser-property-uuid>": "chrome",
    "<build-property-uuid>": "2026.7.27"
  }
}
```

Required active properties with no default must be present on Work Item creation. `select` accepts one option value; `multi_select` accepts a unique list of option values. Use `null` only for non-required properties.

### Parent and child levels

`IssueType.level` ranks a type by breadth, and **lower is broader**: Epic 0 → Feature 1 → Story 2
(Bug also 2) → Task 3. Work-item create/update refuses a parent narrower than its child
(`parent.level <= child.level`), so an Epic filed under a Task is a 400 naming both types.

The rule is deliberately not strict — a Bug (2) parented to the Story (2) it was found in is a real
modelling choice, not an inversion — and untyped work items are exempt, so a project that never
switched types on keeps saving. Upstream Plane numbers its two default types the other way round
(Task 0, Epic 1); this fork follows the seeded data, so do not carry an upstream example's numbers
across.

## Project Overview — app tree only, no API key reaches it

The overview is this fork's product war room: release readiness, progress, milestones, a noticeboard, intake grouped by customer, and the overdue/urgent shortlist. **Every one of these routes exists only under `/api/workspaces/...` with session auth.** There is no `/api/v1` mirror and no MCP tool. An API key gets 404, which reads like a missing project rather than a missing tree — check here before debugging permissions.

Relative to `/api/workspaces/{slug}/projects/{project_uuid}/`:

| Method                  | Path                           | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                 |

### What an agent can still do

Not reaching the panels does not mean not feeding them. Everything they read from is on `/api/v1`:

| To make this appear                 | Write this over `/api/v1`                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| A row in the frontline panel        | `intake-issues/` for the report, then `work-items/{uuid}/properties/{property_uuid}/` to attribute it  |
| A new frontline grouping            | `work-item-properties/` with a `select`/`multi_select` — a human marks it as the dimension in settings |
| An item in the attention panel      | a `work-items/` `target_date` in the past, or `priority: urgent`, in a live state                      |
| A noticeboard topic                 | `labels/` — the panel renders whatever the project has                                                 |
| Movement in progress / release gate | state transitions and test results, as usual                                                           |

The one thing an agent cannot do is post to the noticeboard — `updates/` has no `/api/v1` route at all. Treat that as a property to preserve rather than a gap to close: an announcement is a person telling other people something, and a board that fills itself with generated status is the failure mode this surface was built to replace.

### The grouping dimension

`frontline/` groups by whichever `WorkItemProperty` carries `is_grouping_dimension` — at most one per project, `select` or `multi_select` only. No category name exists in the API: the panel's heading is the property's name, and its rows are the option labels, so one project groups by customer and the next by region without a code change. Read it from `work-item-properties/`; a multi-select value puts one report under several headings, and reports with no value are returned as a `value: null` group rather than dropped.

Intake statuses fold into three answers: pending/snoozed → `pending`, accepted → `accepted`, rejected/duplicate → `declined`. Retriage is `PATCH intake-issues/{issue_uuid}/` with `{"status": 1}`, on either tree — **keyed by the work item's id, not the intake row's**, and ADMIN only. Passing the intake row id returns a 404 that reads like a permissions problem. Status values: `-2` pending, `0` snoozed, `1` accepted, `-1` rejected, `2` duplicate.

## Automation ingestion

```
POST .../testing/automation-ingestions/
X-API-Key: <token>            (public tree)
Idempotency-Key: <stable key>  ← required, 400 if missing
```

JUnit body: `{"format":"junit", "source":"github-actions", "name":"main / test / 421", "build":"<git-sha>", "configuration":{...}, "artifact_ids":["<FileAsset uuid>"], "junit_xml":"<testsuite>..."}`.
Generic body: `{"format":"results", "source":"playwright", "name":"...", "results":[{"external_id":"suite/test-id", "title":"...", "status":"passed", "duration_ms":812, "actual_result":{}, "test_case_id":"<uuid, optional>"}]}`.

Semantics:

- Idempotency: canonical payload sha256 vs stored hash. New → **201**; identical replay → **200** with `replayed:true`; same key + different payload → **409** `IdempotencyConflict`. Key recipe: `{repository}:{workflow_run_id}:{job}:{attempt}`.
- Case mapping order: existing `TestCaseAutomationLink(source, external_id)` → supplied `test_case_id` → **auto-create** a case tagged `["automated"]` (+ link), reported in `diagnostics` as `test_case_created`.
- Each upload creates one fixed run and one result per mapped case; `diagnostics` also reports `invalid_result`, `duplicate_external_id`, `artifact_unavailable`.
- JUnit parser: ≤5 MiB; rejects `<!DOCTYPE`/`<!ENTITY` (XXE); failure/error→`failed`, skipped→`skipped`, else `passed`; `external_id = "classname::name"`.
- Response: `{id, idempotency_key, replayed, test_run:{id,name,status,passed,failed,blocked,skipped,open}, diagnostics}`.
- `artifact_ids` are re-tagged asynchronously (Celery) as testing artifacts; result rows are authoritative regardless of task completion.

## Error contract (public tree)

Every ≥400 response uses a stable envelope and echoes `X-Request-ID` (send your own or one is generated):

```json
{"error": {"code": "http_409", "message": "Only an empty test folder can be deleted.", "details": {...}, "request_id": "<uuid>"}}
```

## Release gate

`overview.release_gate.ready` = a latest run exists AND zero blockers, where blockers = failed/blocked/open cases in the latest run + open defects. A defect is "open" while its issue's state **group** is anything other than `completed` or `cancelled` (state groups come from `states/`). Report blockers, coverage, failures, and open defects together — never infer readiness from one number.

## Which work items owe a contract

`requirement-coverage/` does not return one row per work item, and the rows it does return are not
all in the totals. Two separate decisions, both in `plane/app/views/testing/report.py`, and each row
carries the flag that records them — read the flags rather than re-deriving the rules.

**Which work items get a row**

1. **Only types with `needs_acceptance` produce one.** An implementation task is how something gets
   built, not something the product promises; the story above it carries the promise. The shipped
   default is `true` for Epic/Feature/Story and `false` for Task/Bug. Their linked cases still roll
   up — the walk down the hierarchy does not care whether a child earns a row of its own.
2. **Work items with no type at all are kept.** A project that never adopted types would otherwise
   report nothing, and silence is the one answer a coverage report must not give.
3. **Defects never get one.** A separate rule from #1, and both are needed: the type says what a row
   is _for_, the link says where it _came from_, and a defect filed under some other type is
   evidence rather than a promise.

**Which rows the totals use** — `counts_toward_coverage && requires_contract`

- `counts_toward_coverage` is `false` for a row that summarises other counted rows, at any depth. An
  epic is covered exactly when its stories are; counting it again is a second vote for one decision.
  The row stays in the list so the tree still shows where a gap sits, and its own directly-linked
  contracts still count.
- `requires_contract` is `false` in the `backlog` and `cancelled` state groups. Nobody has scheduled
  the first and the second will never ship. Definition of Ready asks for the contract when work is
  scheduled, so the first state that owes one is whatever `unstarted` state the project schedules
  into.

An uncovered requirement worth reporting is therefore a row with both flags true and
`covered: false` — that set is exactly what the overview counts as in-scope and uncovered.

`needs_acceptance` is a workspace-level field on the type
(`PATCH /workspaces/{slug}/work-item-types/{uuid}/`, both trees). Flipping it changes what every
project in the workspace counts, so treat it as a configuration decision, not a way to move a
number.

## Requirement nature (`requirement_kind`)

`Issue.requirement_kind` carries whether a requirement is functional or a quality constraint:
`functional` | `quality` | `none`, defaulting to `none`.

Unusually, the public tree is the _only_ way in. `/api/v1` `work-items/` reads and writes it like
any other field, while the app tree's serializer omits it from its field list — so the web UI can
neither show nor set it. Everything that reaches the field goes through an API key: the seed
commands, `converge_work_item_types`, and the three tooling surfaces below.

```bash
curl -X PATCH "$BASE/work-items/<issue_uuid>/" -H "X-API-Key: $PLANE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"requirement_kind": "quality"}'
plane-qa issue update --issue QA-12 --requirement-kind quality
# MCP: issue_create / issue_update take requirement_kind
```

Omitting it leaves the stored value alone rather than resetting to `none` — a default would
declassify every requirement touched by an unrelated rename.

Two things follow, and both are mistakes this field exists to prevent:

- **Do not create a work-item type for it.** Type already carries breadth through `level`; adding
  nature multiplies the two axes, and one workspace here reached nine types that way before
  `converge_work_item_types` collapsed them back.
- **Do not create a custom property for it.** A property is defined per project, so every new
  project would have to declare it before the question could be asked at all, and no report
  spanning projects could ask it.

`none` is not `null`: a Task implements a requirement and a Bug reports a broken one, so neither
_is_ one. `null` would read as "not yet classified", which is a different claim. Nothing in the
coverage report reads this field today — `needs_acceptance` decides who owes a contract. It answers
_what kind of promise this is_, not _whether one is owed_.
